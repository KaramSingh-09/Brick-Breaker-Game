# Complete Unity Developer - Section 5 - Block Breaker

This is the [Complete Unity Developer](http://gdev.tv/cudgithub) - one of the most successful e-learning courses on the internet! Completely re-worked from scratch with brand-new projects and our latest teaching techniques. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught over 360,336 students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Complete Unity Developer](http://gdev.tv/cudgithub)

### Setting Up Your Play Space ###



### Ball + Gravity + Colliders = Fun ###

+ Add a ball to your space
+ Import the ball sprite to Sprites folder.
+ Set a sensible “Pixels Per Unit” value.

+ Understanding Gravity Scale

### Creating & Using Unity Prefabs ###

+ What is a prefab in Unity
+ Why prefabs are useful.
+ Setting up your prefabs.

+ How Edit > Snap Settings works.
+ Snap initially to get on the grid.
+ You can do this with multi-select.
+ Hold cmd (ctrl) while dragging!
+ Build your first level

### Making Everything A Prefab ###

+ Make everything a prefab!
+ Set Main Camera background to black.
+ Move & group Loose Collider.
+ Test by making new level.
